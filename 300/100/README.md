# 100 - Create a Scene

Creating a scene in three.js requires setting up the following components beforehand:

- Scene
- Camera
- Light

The ```Scene``` can then be populated using the ```.add()``` property with elements such as the following:

- Mesh

- -- Geometry

- -- Material

- Object3D

- Light

## Initialize the Scene

The scene needs to be initialized after importing the three.js library as shown below:

```
...
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
...
```
js/scripts.js

We can now use ```scene.add``` to add elements to our scene after initializing them. We will start with the camera.
