# 200 - Create a Texture

[Three.js](https://www.educative.io/answers/what-is-threejs) is a JavaScript library that renders animations on the web. It makes use of WebGL for this purpose. Before we can apply texture to a scene, we need to understand how to [create a scene](https://www.educative.io/answers/how-to-create-a-scene-in-threejs) in three.js.

**Textures** (i.e. The appearance of a material) can be loaded and applied to **materials** (i.e. In three.js, materials define the appearance of objectsâ€”the way they appear smooth, rough, or handle reflection of light.), which, when applied to shapes, give them the pattern of the asset that was loaded. 

We can use ```TextureLoader``` to achieve this task.
